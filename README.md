| TM1637 Pin | TM1637 Function | RPi Pin | RPi Function | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GND | Ground  | 6/9/14/20/25/30/34/39 | GND     | Any ground pin is fine |
| VCC | 5V      | 2/4                   | 5V      | Any 5V pin is fine, also works with 3V3 in case you're in a tight spot |
| DI0 | Data in | 18                    | GPIO 24 | Default pin in the program, can be changed to other GPIO pins. Just make sure it's a valid GPIO pin. |
| CLK | Clock   | 16                    | GPIO 23 | Default pin in the program, can be changed to other GPIO pins. Just make sure it's a valid GPIO pin. |
